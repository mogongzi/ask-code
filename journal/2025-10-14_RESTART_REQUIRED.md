# ‚ö†Ô∏è RESTART REQUIRED - Configuration Changes

**Date:** 2025-10-14
**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è Restart Needed

## Issue Detected

The agent is still using **old configuration values**:
- Current: `max_react_steps: 15`
- Expected: `max_react_steps: 20`

Evidence from the log:
```
INFO     ReactRailsAgent initialized | {"project_root": "/Users/I503354/jam/local/ct", "max_steps": 15, "available_tools": 9}
```

The recent test run hit the 15-step limit again:
```
INFO     ReAct loop stopped: Maximum steps (15) reached
```

## Root Cause

The `ride_rails.py` process (PID 71736) was started **before** the configuration changes were saved. Python loads configuration values at import time, so the running process is using the old cached values.

## Solution

**Restart the application** to pick up the new configuration:

```bash
# Stop the current process (Ctrl+C in the terminal where it's running)
# OR kill the process
kill 71736

# Restart with the new configuration
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 ride_rails.py --project /Users/I503354/jam/local/ct --verbose
```

## Verification

After restarting, check the initialization log for the new max_steps value:

```
# Expected log output
INFO     ReactRailsAgent initialized | {"max_steps": 20, ...}
```

## Configuration Changes Applied

The following files were modified and need the process restart to take effect:

1. **agent/config.py:19** - `max_react_steps: 10 ‚Üí 20`
2. **agent/config.py:34-35** - `finalization_threshold: 2 ‚Üí 3`, `tool_repetition_limit: 3 ‚Üí 4`
3. **prompts/system_prompt.py:74-89** - New investigation limits and stopping criteria
4. **agent/response_analyzer.py:199** - Callback investigation window extended to step 10
5. **agent/response_analyzer.py:316-325** - New step 12 finalization trigger

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ Stop the current `ride_rails.py` process
2. ‚úÖ Restart with the same command
3. ‚úÖ Re-run the same SQL transaction query
4. ‚úÖ Verify agent finalizes between steps 12-14 (not 15)

The changes are correct in the source files - they just need a process restart to activate! üîÑ
