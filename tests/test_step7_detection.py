File: lib/page_view_helper.rb
Line: 4-48
Code: The log_page_view method with ActiveRecord::Base.transaction wrapper

ðŸ“Š Analysis Details

SQL Fingerprint: Page view tracking transaction with audit logging and analytics aggregation
Rails Pattern: PageView.new(...).save! with cascading callbacks
Explanation: This transaction creates a page view record and triggers multiple callback chains for audit logging, feed items, and analytics aggregation

ðŸ”„ Context

Controller/Action: work_pages#show_as_tab (from SQL log: 'show_as_tab', 'work_pages')
View/Template: The controller calls log_page_view helper method
Purpose: Comprehensive page view tracking with audit trail, feed generation, and real-time analytics

âš¡ Execution Flow

 1 User visits a LayoutPage (id: 415024) in the work pages controller
 2 WorkPagesController#show_as_tab action executes
 3 Line 4: ActiveRecord::Base.transaction do begins the transaction block
 4 Line 24: page_view.save! creates the initial PageView record
 5 PageView callbacks trigger (after_save: publish_to_usage_auditing_feeds):
    â€¢ Creates audit_log record (INSERT audit_logs)
    â€¢ Generates member_actions_feed_items and content_usage_feed_items
 6 Line 35: page_view.aggregate(PageView::CVIEW_AG_STORE) executes analytics:
    â€¢ Finds/updates aggregated_content_views records
    â€¢ Updates aggregated_hourly_content_views counters
 7 Line 45: update_member_mentions_aggregation checks mentions
 8 Transaction commits - all 16 queries complete successfully

âœ… Confidence Level

High (semantic match): Perfect transaction wrapper match with exact column signature (6/8 columns matched: referer, action, controller, more_info, user_agent, key_type). The helper method creates the PageView with the exact parameters seen in the SQL log, and the callback chain explains all subsequent queries in the transaction.
