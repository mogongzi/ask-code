Scientists believe this is due to a mutation in a key taste receptor.\nWhen a cat chases its prey, it keeps its head level. Dogs and humans bob their heads up and down.\nThe technical term for a cat’s hairball is a “bezoar.”\nA group of cats is called a “clowder.”\nFemale cats tend to be right pawed, while male cats are more often left pawed. Interestingly, while 90% of humans are right handed, the remaining 10% of lefties also tend to be male.\nA cat can’t climb head first down a tree because every claw on a cat’s paw points the same way. To get down from a tree, a cat must back down.\nCats make about 100 different sounds. Dogs make only about 10.\nA cat’s brain is biologically more similar to a human brain than it is to a dog’s. Both humans and cats have identical regions in their brains that are responsible for emotio",

This grave predates early Egyptian art depicting cats by 4,000 years or more.\nDuring the time of the Spanish Inquisition, Pope Innocent VIII condemned cats as evil and thousands of cats were burned.

Even cats without a tail have this ability.\nA cat rubs against people not only to be affectionate but also to mark out its territory with scent glands around its face. The tail area and paws also carry the cat’s scent.\nResearchers are unsure exactly how a cat purrs. Most veterinarians believe that a cat purrs by vibrating vocal folds deep in the throat. To do this, a muscle in the larynx opens and closes the air passage about 25 times per second.\nWhen a family cat died in ancient Egypt, family members would mourn by shaving off their eyebrows.

Tabbies got their name because their striped coats resembled the famous wavy patterns in the silk produced in this city.\nCats hate the water because their fur does not insulate well when it’s wet. The Turkish Van, however, is one cat that likes swimming. Bred in central Asia, its coat has a unique texture that makes it water resistant.\nThe Egyptian Mau is probably the oldest breed of cat. In fact, the breed is so ancient that its name is the Egyptian word for “cat.”\nThe costliest cat ever is named Little Nicky, who cost his owner $50,000. He is a clone of an older cat.\nA cat usually has about 12 whiskers on each side of its face.\nA cat’s eyesight is both better and worse than humans. It is better because cats can see in much dimmer light and they have a wider peripheral view. It’s worse because they don’t see color as well as humans do. Scientists ",

These worms live inside the cat forever, or until they are removed with medication. They reproduce by shedding a link from the end of their long bodies. This link crawls out the cat’s anus, and sheds hundreds of eggs. These eggs are injected by flea larvae, and the cycle continues. Humans may get these tapeworms too, but only if they eat infected fleas. Cats with tapeworms should be dewormed by a veterinarian.\nCats can get tapeworms from eating mice.

      "text": " first cat show was in 1871 at the Crystal Palace in London.\nToday there are about 100 distinct breeds of the domestic cat.\nLike birds, cats have a homing ability that uses its biological clock, the angle of the sun, and the Earth’s magnetic field. A cat taken far from its home can return to it. But if a cat’s owners move far from its home, the cat can’t find them.\nCats bury their feces to cover their trails from predators.\nCats sleep 16 to 18 hours per day. When cats are asleep, they are still alert to incoming stimuli. If you poke the tail of a sleeping cat, it will respond accordingly.\nBesides smelling with their nose, cats can smell with an additional organ called the Jacobson’s organ, located in the upper surface of the mouth.\nThe chlorine in fresh tap water irritates sensitive parts of the cat’s nose. Let tap water sit for 24 hours before giving it to a cat.\n",
